## Immcantation

The Immcantation framework provides a start-to-finish analytical ecosystem for high-throughput AIRR-seq datasets. Beginning from raw reads, Python and R packages are provided for pre-processing, population structure determination, and repertoire analysis.

You can find full documentation for all of the core packages here: [immcantation.com](https://immcantation.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
